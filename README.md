## Hi there 👋 I'm Boloka Kgopodithate

<!--
**SageBoots/SageBoots** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on small game projects to experiment with game mechanics and systems in Unity
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 2D pixel animation and how to use game engines such as Unity and Unreal
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on developing an anime-inspired, sprite-based, 2D action-RPG along the veins of Dead Cells, Katana Zero or titles in the styles of Metroidvanias
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with pixel animation, music, world and character design
- 💬 Ask me about history, video games, cartoons or anime and chances are I'll know what I'm talking about
- ⚡ Fun fact: The game Assassin's Creed 3 is what started me down the path to becoming a programmer
